Edifact/ANSI X12: Nationalized healthcare cowboys and insane, ungovernered, HIPAA Healthcare BioSphereWaste by ANSI X12

Fix yourself! Officious Clandestine Counterfix
Stephan Bax, Duke "Kneedeep" of the LowLands Mystic Tribes

A temp Edifact fix: Better, easier and more accesible syntax rules to structure data,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML/EDIFACT
Maintainer: UN/CEFACT

Probems: 
Mess, Binaries, list, roadmaps, todo's. and proprietary formats misusing sane standards with wrong definitions and grouping. support for Postgres DBm Mulesoft, IBM Integration Bus (IIB).

Affected Formats: 
Data format in information technology may refer to a file format as a format for encoding data for storage in a computer file or to a datatype, constraint placed upon the interpretation of data in a type system.

Management summary:
Edifact/ANSI X12: Nationalized healthcare cowboys and insane, ungovernered, HIPAA Healthcare BioSphereWaste by ANSI X12

If it is required to develop new standards (for example formats, code lists, syntax bindings etc.), it wouldbe easier to build upon the existing work within TC440. This means that needs within Catalogues, Ordering, Fulfilment and Invoice can be developed faster

Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication
SWIFT has been in use for several decades and most importantly, is semi TRUSTED, due to facilitating leaks.

In 2015, SWIFT linked more than 11,000 financial institutions, incl. Commercial Bank of China, BBVA, Citi, ING Bank, Standard Chartered, ABN AMRO, DBS Bank, Industrial Intesa Sanpaolo, Nordea Bank en UniCredit, in more than 200 countries and territories, or landcorridors, who were exchanging an average of over 15 million messages per day. 
NoteSB: Transactions mixing it all up! Confusion infected mushroom defcon level!!!

SWIFT operates under Belgian law and was not exactly on the same page as the U.S. (they politely tried telling them to fuck off) but the USA being the USA, some type of agreement was eventually made, Terrorist Finance Tracking Program.

Swift is in defence mode against decentralization, resulting in Global Payments Innovation, GPI:
