The Web was an invention to benefit humanity; today it's a private spyingmachine, disrupting society. Trump has a #Bigtech problem, but humanity have humanitarian problem. USA gov. has bipartisan support (#Stazi reincatnation) for legalizing #nextgen #spytech. So this hostage situation is going to last for another 10 years at least, with all those delaying procedures, and changes in government. It's a war among elite, at the expanse of WethePeople. 

Why #patents aren't discussed in #healthcare? 
#bigpharma #drugdealers hiding behind definitions?

#FactsMatter #healthcare #laws #humanrights #ip

Given the goals of Intellectual Property laws, the sake of the users is more important than the sake of the #Creators since it is the majority and since human rights outweigh property rights. New IP laws need to evolve based on the concept of incentives, diverting current restrictive mindset.

Attorney General William Barr recused himself from from the Attorney General appointment from any review of the earlier plea deal that allowed Epstein to avoid federal charges in Florida. But Barr, who practiced at Kirkland in 2009 and then again in 2017 until 2019, has consulted with Justice Department ethics officials and will not recuse himself from overseeing Epstein‚Äôs new criminal case.

Assange's health
There is a reason UN Human Rights isn't hooked into Wikileaks/Assange case.
It would join economics into human rights, building a much broader and richer foundation for peace.

Media Posed by the Trump Administration‚Äôs Prosecution of Julian Assange

Indeed, I don't use you for changing definitions. I use you to set an example. You are #disrupting #peace by blocking #solutions. You are a #gatekeeper without real understanding. You have a technology gap and your ego makes you act as if you know and understand. Dilmun, Melluhah and Magan is what I start with.

Criminal investigation into UK Prime Ministers but ‚Äústrong conflict of interest‚Äù requires Lady Arbuthnot to stand down from Assange‚Äôs case. Her husband was exposed by WikiLeaks, overseeing the UK Ministry of Defence 2005-2014: Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria. Wikileaks legally distributed content that Assange even anonimized while TheGuardian set him up and broke the law.
UK claims it won't extradite Julian Assange to a country where capital punishment isn‚Äôt banned while Assange is charged from Virgina Stazi Court.

British Deputy Foreign Secretary Alan Duncan. "London won‚Äôt extradite Julian Assange to a country where capital punishment isn‚Äôt banned, that is, the USA.".
